# Useful Tools
## File Format Handlers

### **Kuriimu2**
Kuriimu2 is a fan translation toolkit that supports nearly every non-model related YW file format.
It can be found [here](https://github.com/FanTranslatorsInternational/Kuriimu2) and uses a hyper-flexible plugin system so you can easily contribute to the project (I myself am planning to make a PR to add support for Icon CTPK reading)
> *Note: Kuriimu2 dosent support text editing as of yet but its predecesor Kuriimu does!*

### **Kuriimu**
Kuriimu, Karameru, and Kukkii combined form the predecesor to **Kuriimu2**. These have the benefit of text editing despite being older! They can be found [here](https://github.com/IcySon55/Kuriimu).

### Mobius
Mobius is a tool used for viewing and modifying `moflex` files that are found in Yo-kai Watch 3DS titles. 
To use this tool you must have `ffmpeg.exe` in the same folder as the executable. FFMPeg can be found [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
Mobius may give you an error or a corrupted output if you don't configure the config right, try opening the .config in notepad and using this line instead of the old one: 
`<add key="options" value="-preset ultrafast -crf 16"/>`
This should fix the corrupted output issue.
Mobius can be found [here](https://github.com/AdibSurani/Mobius).
