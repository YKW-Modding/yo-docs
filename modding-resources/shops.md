# Shops
The following pages will list all the Shop File Names and IDs in the games - labelling them for easy use.
Normal Shops will be in the format `shop_<shopName>_*.cfg.bin`.
A normal shop's `ShopName` is in the following format:
* `shp<type><index>`
  * `<index>` is a 3-digit number used to distinguish between shops of the same type.
  * `<type>` is a capitalised 1/2 letter sequence used to show the type of shop:
    * `N` is used for normal shops - this is the most common shop type.
    * `M` is used for Vending Machines - there are only a handful of these.
    * `KP` is used exclusively for the BP (Battle Points) shop.
    * `TVM` is used exclusively for the Day Pass "shop".
    * `B`
    * `BB`
    * `BC`
    * `PAY`
    * `T`
