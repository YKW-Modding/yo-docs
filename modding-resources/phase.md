# Phase
Phase is a large unsigned 32-bit integer (a number between 0 and 4,294,967,295) which combined with events and flags serves to tell the game how far you are into the story.
The current phase can be obtained in Conds via the function `GetPhase()`. The following sub-pages will list the phase boundaries and what part of the story they belong to.
