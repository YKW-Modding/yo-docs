# BtlCommandIDs
BtlCommandIDs are used to configure all battle effects - from soultimates, skills and souls to items and even sudden death in PvP!

The following pages will give a list of IDs along with a name/description of the ID.

> Note: they are in hex for convenience with the non-0 padded IDs in brackets if there's a leading zero. This is to make Ctrl+F more convenient to use)<br>
> If the name is in japanese an (unoffical) english translation will be shown in brackets.
