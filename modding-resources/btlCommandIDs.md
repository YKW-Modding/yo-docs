# BtlCommandIDs
BtlCommandIDs are used to configure all battle effects - from soultimates, skills and souls to items and even sudden death in PvP!
These pages will give a list of IDs in hex for convenience (with the non-0 padded ID in brackets if there's a leading zero; this is to make Ctrl+F more convenient to use), along with a name/description of the ID. 
If the name is in japanese an (unoffical) english translation will be shown in brackets.
