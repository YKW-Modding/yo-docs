ItemIDs are used to reprsent Items. There are the following item types:
* `Creature` - Critters (Mainline only).
* `Important` - Key Items.
* `Soul` - Souls (YW2 onwards).
* `Equipment` - Non-Soul Equippables.
* `Consume` - Everything Else.
* `Element` - Shards and such (B1/B2 only!!).
* `Auras` - I dont remember if Blasters Auras are items - but theyll be included here anyway!

Not to be confused with `InventorySort` or `ItemType`.
