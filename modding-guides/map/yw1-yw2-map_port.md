# YW1 -> YW2
For Yo-kai Watch 1 to Yo-kai Watch 2, the only change you need to make is NPCs:
* You might need to place npcs in an `npc.pck` for them to register.
* If the YW1 NPC has `OnTalk` scripts, you must convert them into a trigger in the YW2 mapâ€™s `.xq` file:
This is an *extremely simple* process and definetly the easiest port.
