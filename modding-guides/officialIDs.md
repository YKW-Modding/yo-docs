# Creating Official IDs
Yo-kai Watch uses many IDs, from Item IDs (i.e. `0xC8142475`) to  Map IDs to Shop IDs - almost everything has an ID.
These are generated via the standard CRC-32 algorithm (ISO 3309/ISO-HDLC) which can be generated by typing text into a tool like [this](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/crc/).
Have you ever wondered what pattern yw games use do they just use a random valid CRC-32? No, there are actual patterns although the game dosent check for them (meaning you dont *need to follow this ever*) - this is a list of the patterns for common IDs:

## Item IDs
This is the most complicated one:

## Base IDs
### YW1
For Yo-kai Watch 1, its the CRC-32 of last 4 characters of the file name i.e. `y333`.
### YW2+
For Yo-kai Watch 2 and later, its the CRC-32 of the *whole file name* i.e. `y137000`.

## Param IDs
ParamIDs are the exact same as BaseIDs but with a `para_` added at the start (the missing m is intentional!).

## Map IDs and others
Other IDs, such as Map IDs are simply the CRC-32 of the *file name*. i.e. an example of a Map ID would be the CRC-32 of `t101g00`.
