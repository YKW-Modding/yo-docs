There are several types of flags with the most common type being `GlobalBitFlags`; these are *boolean* meaning they can be either a `1` (enabled/true) or a `0` (disabled/false); you can get/set these in XQ via `get_global_bitflag()` and `set_global_bitflag()`. Another common type is `GlobalByteFlags` which are *8-bit integers* meaning they can be any number between 0 and 255.

## Creating GlobalBitFlags
* Navigate over to `data/res/sys/`
* There you will find a `flag_config.cfg.bin` - open it.
  * If you see multiple, pick the one with the largest number i.e. if theres `flag_config.cfg.bin` and `flag_config_0.01a.cfg.bin`, pick the second option.
* Click on `FLAG_INFO_0`.
  * Increase the `ChildCount` by 1.
* Duplicate the last entry in `FLAG_INFO_0` and select the newly created entry.
* Increase the `FlagSlot` by 1.
* Create a new ID for the `FlagID` field, you can do this by typing anything into a website like [this](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/crc/).
* Save and Enjoy!
