This glitch allows you to enter unintended loading zones, such as Breezy Hills, earlier than intended. It is done by using the pushback from the loading zone to clip into a car, then using the car to push you past the trigger that blocks the loading zone. This triggers the loading zone successfully, allowing you to get to Breezy Hills as early as Chapter 2.
