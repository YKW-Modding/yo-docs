This glitch allows you to use all of your stamina and then not become tired by doing an action to interrupt losing your last sliver of stamina (usually a frame-perfect dodge). The stamina wheel will look as if you ran of stamina, but you can walk and sprint freely.

If you sprint and run out of stamina in this state, you will become tired as normal. When all of your stamina recharges, the stamina wheel will go back to normal.
