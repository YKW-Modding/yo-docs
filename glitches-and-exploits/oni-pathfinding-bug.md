This is caused by the Oni running into a corner of an object at a precise angle which causes it to get stuck. This semi-frequently occurs naturally although there is no known way to reliably recreate it at any given moment. It may be possible to fix this glitch by adjusting the `.astarbin` to make the Oni's avoid areas they could be trapped in although this has not been attempted yet.
