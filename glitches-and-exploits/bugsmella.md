After the Ironworks quest in Yo-kai Watch 2, all the Yo-kai you befriend will simply become Badsmella. The actual Yo-kai you were meant to get will be the one that walks up to you, but then the name will be Badsmella and the Yo-kai you receive will be Badsmella. This can be stopped by restarting the game.

The reason this happens is because you meet the befriending requirement for Badsmella during the miniboss, but you obviously can't get Badsmella after that fight. This causes every subsequent Yo-kai you befriend to be Badsmella.

This can actually happen for any battle against possessed Yo-kai, which includes the possessed Yo-kai in Chapter 10. This means that you could befriend a Yo-kai like Mad Kappa without needing to perform fusion. However, this has only been tested with a befriending cheat.
